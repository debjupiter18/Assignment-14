a) What is the difference between Internal Storage & External Storage?
 
Internal Storage: By default, files saved to the internal storage are private to your application and other applications cannot access them. 
When the user uninstalls your application, these files are removed/deleted. Your app user also can't access them using file manager; 
even after enabling "show hidden files" option in file manager. To access files in Internal Storage, you have to root your Android phone. 
So, this is NOT what we think as internal memory of the phone - Nexus 5's 32 GB internal memory.

External Storage:

    This can be a removable storage media (such as an SD card) or an internal (non-removable) storage

    That means, both storage types like Nexus 6P's 64 GB internal memory and removable microSD card which we insert in phone's card slot are considered as External Storage.

    Removable Storage means just microSD card storage, not the internal memory.

    To store your app files in SD card, you may use File[] getExternalFilesDirs (String type) method in Context class. 
	Generally, second returned path would be the storage path for microSD card (if any).  

b) For how long the data resides in the cache?

Clear app data — or resetting an app.  You're wiping the cache, but also clearing any and all settings that go along with that app. 
You're basically starting that app over, from scratch, and it'll behave as it did the first time you installed it.

c) What are the critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? What are the
examples of each?

The Normal permissions do not directly affect the user’s privacy. 
If application lists a normal permission in its manifest, then these permissions will be automatically granted by the system upon installation. 
Some of the most common normal permissions are given below.

Check and change data connection: Include network state, Wi-Fi State, Bluetooth, Internet, etc.

Example:

CCESS_LOCATION_EXTRA_COMMANDS
ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
ACCESS_NOTIFICATION_POLICY
ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
BLUETOOTH
BLUETOOTH_ADMIN and many more are there.

Critical permissions are those permissions which are associated with access of your sensitive data like Location, Contacts or writing some data to any external drive etc.
Example:
For instance, Google Maps would be pretty useless if it couldn’t access your location, but when a calculator app needs access to your contacts, 
that should raise concern. This was the source of the Facebook Messenger app’s controversy a while ago, 
because people felt that the app was overstepping its bound on permissions
Some Google enlisted critical permissions can be like this--
READ_CALENDAR
WRITE_CALENDAR
CAMERA
READ_CONTACTS
WRITE_CONTACTS
GET_ACCOUNTS
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION
RECORD_AUDIO
READ_PHONE_STATE
READ_PHONE_NUMBERS 
CALL_PHONE
ANSWER_PHONE_CALLS 
READ_CALL_LOG
